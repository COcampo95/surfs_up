The mean temperature of approx. 75°F for June is higher than the mean temperature of 71°F for December. However, the opposite is true for precipitation. December had the higher precipitation of .22 inches while June had approx. .14 inches.


#Summary
The investor's main concern was getting rained out too frequently. Comparing the June and December weather patterns, the temperatures and precipitation means are reasonably close. The temperature data is not strongly skewed for either month. The data suggests a Surf and Ice Cream shop can be open year-round.
